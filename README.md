This is a phoenix app with webpack v5 and typescript enabled.
This app is also set up to be able to compile a typescript service worker.

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `yarn install` inside the `assets` directory
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4001`](http://localhost:4001) from your browser.
